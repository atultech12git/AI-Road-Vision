AI Road Vision is an AI-based road monitoring system developed using Machine Learning, Deep Learning,and Computer Vision to detect road defects and obstacles such as potholes, speed breakers, road dividers, and roadside obstacles from camera input.

The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on road image datasets to identify hazardous road conditions. Image preprocessing techniques are applied to improve model performance and accuracy.

The trained model is integrated with Python and OpenCV to perform real-time detection using a live camera feed. Each frame is analyzed to identify road anomalies and highlight them, making the system suitable for smart transportation and road safety applications.

This project demonstrates the practical use of AI for road safety, smart city infrastructure, and automated road condition monitoring, reducing the need for manual inspection and helping detect road hazards early.
